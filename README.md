# My Django Reading Lists

Welcome to my reading list of Django books and tutorials, mostly generated or assisted by LLMs. This static site is hosted on GitHub Pages directly from the root of the `main` branch.

## Available Books

* [Django Testing with Pytest](./Django_Testing_with_Pytest/00_front-matters.html)
* [Full Stack Django](./Full_Stack_Django/00_front-matters.html)

*More books and tutorials will be added here over time.*

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
   cd <your-repo>
   ```
2. Open the site locally by opening `index.html` or any of the links above in your browser.
3. To add new books, create a new directory or add HTML files, then update this README with links.

## Hosted on GitHub Pages

This site is published at:

```
https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo>/
```

No build step is requiredâ€”simply push to the `main` branch and GitHub Pages will update automatically.
